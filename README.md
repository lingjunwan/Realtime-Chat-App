# Realtime-Chat-App  
## Project Overview  
Realtime Chat App is a full-stack chat app which could support group chats, 1-on-1 chats, realtime messaging, image and file support, read receipts and more!  
`Node JS` and `express` are used for the backend. All the chat data will be stored on `ChatEngine.io` which has APIs and Socket channels for hosting chats.  
`ReactJS` and the pre-built Chat UI components `react-chat-engine-pretty` are used for the frontend. Chat Engineâ€™s NPM components are free building blocks for Chat UIs.

## Features  
1. Send messages.  

2. Send images / files.  

3. DMs and Group Chats.  

4. `CSS` and the midnight UI `react-chat-engine-pretty` are used to enhance the UI of the app.  

5. All users in our Chat Engine project can chat with one another through `ChatEngine APIs/platform`.  

6. `express` is the HTTP server framework.  

7. `cors` enables processing requests from other hosts (for the ReactJS app).  

8. `axios` allows sending HTTP requests to other servers (for Chat Engine APIs).  

9. `nodemon` allows running the server in dev-mode.  

10. It's a website that's compatible with mobile devices. It is developed with mobile users in mind and as such very responsive which gives mobile users the same sleek GUI and function as the web users.  

# Getting Started with Realtime Chat App

This project was bootstrapped with `Vite`.  
Vite is a build tool that focuses on providing fast development and build times for modern web applications. It is designed to be a lighter and faster alternative to tools like Create React App (CRA)

## Available Scripts

In the project `backend` directory, you can run:

### `npm start`  

In the project `frontend` directory, you can run:

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
